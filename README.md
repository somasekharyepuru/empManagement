you need to run both the servers first angular and then mockserver

for running mock-server
go to mockServer folder --> npm start


for running angular
npm start


do npm install in both the folders if you face any issues (better do npm install if any packages added)

you can find your db in mockserver/db.json

you can find users list in the db.json--> users

you can find kpiValues insertion in the db.json --> kpiValues


**Happy Coding**
